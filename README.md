<h1>Last.Fm Scrobbler</h1>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>This was a code concept that I developed for a start-up I was doing contract work for.</p>
<p>A little bit of background: LastFm is a popular music streaming platform. Interestingly, LastFm does not stream music tracks from a database that they maintain (like Spotify does this). When a user listens to a track on LastFm, they often times are in fact listening to to a version of said track hosted on Youtube. This technically makes LastFm a relay service whith no concrete path for a user to easily purchase a track from some retailer.</p> 
<p>This program solves that problem by pulling a user's currently playing track information and then uses it to querey Spotify to find their equivalant track entry so the user can locate it on that platform.</p>
<p>I wrote this program using the React JavaScript platform</p>
